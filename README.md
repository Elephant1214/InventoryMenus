# Inventory Menus
A simple inventory menu utility, features DSL support similar to [InventoryGUI](https://github.com/devproje/InventoryGUI)'s, but makes menus. More types will be supported whenever I get to it (or need them).

## Usage
Get the library from Jitpack, initialize it in the main class using your plugin, then start making menus. You must provide Kotlin >= 2.1.10.
